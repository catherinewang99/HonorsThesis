Data source documentation:

The data for this study comes from a paper written by Platt, J. R., & Johnson, D. M. (1971). The paper is titled Localization of position within a homogeneous behavior chain: Effects of error contingencies. 

The dataset itself is a study of numerosity cognition done on two rats. It has a series of data features, including means, standard deviations, and frequencies of guesses for numbers.

This dataset is publicly available and has been discussed in more recent papers. It can be found here: https://osf.io/qb3sm/

There are possibilities for bias and error in this data, primarily because it is an older study, and newer studies showing more precise findings may be available. For the purposes of this study, it is the most relevant dataset to look at.
